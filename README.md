# Python_Non_AI_Windows_Voice_Control
- Python 3.8.5 was used during creation and local debugging.
- A python code which accepts commands as audio and then executes a command from the commands the programmer has included in the code. 
- The code is executable only from the command terminal. 
- Please add the required PATH environment variable names in the README file. I haven't used any commands requiring additional PATH values, but be sure to have python3 in your PATH values as you will require it to run this via the CMD.
